			<h6>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From childhood's hour I have not been
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As others were -- I have not seen
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As others saw -- I could not bring
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My passions from a common spring --
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the same source I have not taken
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My sorrow -- I could not awaken
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My heart to joy at the same tone --
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all I lov'd -- I lov'd alone --
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then -- in my childhood -- in the dawn
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of a most stormy life -- was drawn
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From ev'ry depth of good and ill
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			The mystery which binds me still --&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			From the torrent, or the fountain --&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			From the red cliff of the mountain --&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			From the sun that 'round me roll'd&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			In its autumn tint of gold --&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			From the lightning in the sky&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			As it pass'd me flying by --&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			From the thunder, and the storm --&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			And the cloud that took the form&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			(When the rest of Heaven was blue)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			Of a demon in my view --
